# Organising Work

Techniques and principles for structuring project work into clear, communicable units.

## Capabilities

### Naming Milestones

Generate outcome-focused milestone names from rough descriptions. Follows a structured workflow: gather context, ask clarifying questions, then generate options.

See [references/naming-milestones.md](references/naming-milestones.md) for principles, workflow, and examples.

### Writing Task Tickets

Write clear, complete task tickets that give the assignee everything they need to start work. Covers context, action items, impact, and success criteria. Includes Jira field mapping and persistence via Otter MCP.

See [references/writing-task-tickets.md](references/writing-task-tickets.md) for template, principles, Jira field mapping, and examples.
