# Naming Milestones

## Workflow

1. Take the user's rough description of a milestone
2. Ask clarifying questions if the scope, audience, or intent is ambiguous
3. Generate 2-3 milestone name options following the principles below
4. Let the user pick or refine

## Principles

- Frame as an **outcome**, not an artefact ("Enable X" or "Establish X", not "Build X dashboard")
- Use active verbs: Define, Establish, Enable, Surface, Deliver, Align, Expand, Support
- Keep to a single sentence, ideally under 15 words
- Avoid implementation detail — focus on what becomes possible, not how
- Scope precisely — a milestone should be achievable and demonstrable
- When a concept has a hierarchy, reflect the correct level of abstraction
- Avoid generic filler words like "robust", "comprehensive", "seamless" unless they add real meaning

## Examples

- Establish ownership attribution for resources at individual and team level
- Support ownership transitions as organisational structures evolve
- Define and implement lifecycle states to support governance workflows
- Enable authors to compose pages using design system components within the CMS
- Deliver a visual drag-and-drop composition experience within the authoring tool
- Define and populate content type domains within the platform
- Define a foundational metadata taxonomy to enable consistent classification
- Enable engineering teams to integrate through a documented API library
- Establish data lineage to track content and component sources end-to-end
- Enable visibility into library usage, freshness, and ownership
- Surface component utilisation and coverage metrics across the design system
- Map structured fields to design system components
- Define processes and examples to enable consistent use of structured content
- Define a governance model for content authoring and publication
- Align platform properties to relevant content types in the shared library
- Expand use cases and usage across dependent teams and localisation
