# Slack & Informal Comms

Format-specific guidance for Slack DMs, help channel replies, stakeholder updates, and thread responses.

## Channel-Specific Color

- **#help channels**: concise approvals and clear shipping signals ("Absolutely!", "LGTM!", "It's live"), plus concrete links and timing
- **Stakeholder/cross-team channels**: teaching moments, options framing, gentle course-corrections

## Example Patterns

These are illustrative patterns, not verbatim past messages.

### Help channel response (simple unblock)

> Heya — got it. We can ship the URL hookup today; expect prod within 1-2 days. Share the CMS entity link and preferred path and I'll get a PR up.

### Stakeholder scoping (options + plan)

> Morning! Happy to scope. Do you want a quick pass (just us, ballparks) or a deeper session with a couple of engs to cut the bus factor? I can hold Fri 2pm — shout if an earlier slot opens.

### Bug triage (ack + next step)

> Thanks for flagging — we'll take a look first thing and drop notes on the PR. If it's impacting the team broadly, we'll merge a fix ASAP.

### Experiment setup coaching

> What's the goal you're optimising for? Work backwards from that. Check the relevant guide; then we can pick params and variants together.

## Pre-Send Checklist

1. Lead with a warm hello
2. State the outcome and timing
3. Ask 1-3 clarifying Qs max
4. Bullet the next steps with owners
5. Drop the links/PRs
6. Close the loop later ("Looping back—status")
