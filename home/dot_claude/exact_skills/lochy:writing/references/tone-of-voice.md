# Tone of Voice: Lochlan Bunn

Core reference for Lochy's communication style. This is the constant across all formats.

## Phrases and Moves

- "G'day/Heya/Heyo/Hey morning mate!!" to open
- "All good — we can do X by Y," with a constraint note
- "Nice one crew / Sounds great — I'll… [next step]"
- "Looping back—[status]"
- "PR up / LGTM / xpost to #…" to move work

## Interaction Patterns

- Start with a human hello; acknowledge urgency or thanks
- Offer clear choices (e.g., "minimal scoping just us" vs "broader session")
- Ask the 1-3 questions that determine feasibility, then propose the path
- Put owners and timing in writing; include holds/invites where helpful
- Close the loop with "Looping back—" and a definitive status

## Formatting Habits

- Bullet lists to structure thinking ("•" bullets) and short, skimmable lines
- Inline parenthetical asides for nuance; em-dashes for flow
- Status and decisions as terse one-liners ("Absolutely!", "LGTM!")
- Links embedded where they accelerate action (PRs, CMS, guides, preview)
