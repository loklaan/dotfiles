# Compressing Information

Compress content using the U-Turn compression methodology—a 3-stage semantic lossless compression pipeline applied in a single pass.

## Compression Pipeline

Execute all three stages as a unified logical process:

### Stage 1: Semantic Structured Compression

De-linearize content into self-contained atomic facts:

- Extract discrete, standalone statements of fact
- Apply entropy-based filtering to remove redundancy
- Each atom must be independently meaningful
- Preserve semantic relationships implicitly through careful wording

### Stage 2: Structured Indexing

Synthesize atoms into higher-order molecular insights:

- Identify patterns and relationships across atoms
- Consolidate related facts into unified abstractions
- Eliminate remaining redundancy through synthesis
- Create hierarchical structure where applicable

### Stage 3: Adaptive Retrieval Formatting

Prune and format across semantic, lexical, and symbolic layers:

- **Semantic**: Preserve meaning, drop verbose phrasing
- **Lexical**: Use precise terminology, abbreviate where unambiguous
- **Symbolic**: Use notation, bullets, structure over prose

## Output Format

Produce compressed output that:
- Maximizes information density
- Remains human-readable without expansion
- Preserves all essential semantics from the original
- Uses structural hierarchy (indentation, bullets, groupings)
